# Raspberry Pi Pico W

This project involves building a personal weather station using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and several sensors including a raindrop sensor, BMP180, and DHT22. The weather station monitors various weather parameters including rainfall, temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude. This project enables the user to collect real-time weather data and provides an opportunity to analyze and understand the local weather patterns in detail.
